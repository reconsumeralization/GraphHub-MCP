FastMCP Builder Index

This module exposes the public API surface for the builder package, with a focus on agent usability and seamless agent integration within the GUI workflow builder.

Key Features:
- GUI code (`gui_launcher`) is separated from headless APIs (`workflow_manager`) and the execution engine.
- Agent logic is in the `fastmcp.agent` package, but agent tools and planners are exposed for builder/GUI use.
- All imports are explicit for static analysis and type checking.
- Types are consolidated in `types.py`; all public APIs are fully type-annotated.
- Agentic node types (SemanticTargetNode, SemanticTriggerNode, ActionRecorderNode) are registered and visible in the GUI.
- NodeRegistry is the single source of truth for node discovery, including agentic and custom nodes.
- TODO: Remove any remaining # type: ignore suppressions by refining signatures and implementing missing methods.
- See README for usage and CLI docs.

Agent-first, GUI-powered, and ready for next-gen automation. ‚òïÔ∏èüöÄ
